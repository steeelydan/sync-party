# Sync Party

---

**v0.12.0 is a massive breaking change.** If you have an instance of SyncParty deployed with data you care about, please make sure to **copy the following files** to a different directory **before** pulling the new version:

-   `server/db` (the database)
-   `server/uploads` (all uploaded files)
-   `server/persistence.json` (current playing position for each item, for each user)

After pulling the current version, create a `data` directory on 1st level.

After setting up (see below), copy both files as well as the `uploads` folder back into `data`. If you run `npm run prod:deploy` now, the app should work the same as before. Fingers crossed ðŸ¤ž

## Supported media sources

-   Uploaded video or audio files (`.mp4`, `.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.flac` etc.)

## Hosting SyncParty

### Requirements

-   A Linux VPS (tested with Ubuntu 22.04)
    -   Unfortunately, at the moment you can't deploy SyncParty on non-persisting nodes, like Heroku.
-   git
-   Node.js >= 18
-   pm2 globally installed
-   SSL certificate (e.g. Let's Encrypt)

### Setup

-   Clone the repository
-   `npm ci`
-   Copy `.env.example` into a new `.env`
-   Configure the `.env` file:
    -   `NODE_ENV=production`
    -   Choose a **different** port for the server & the websockets server. `3000` and `4000` work just fine; they are also used in the nginx example below.
    -   Choose a solid, random SESSION_SECRET
-   Use a reverse proxy to map requests to your domain to the app and use SSL (see example below)
-   Make sure your firewall is configured correctly
-   You might want to use a tool like `authbind` to run pm2 without root; see https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/specifics/#listening-on-port-80-w-o-root
-   `npm run prod:deploy`

### nginx Reverse Proxy Example

```conf
    server_name syncparty.YOURSITE.xyz;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    location /socket.io/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:4000/socket.io/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }

    location /peerjs/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/peerjs/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }

    client_max_body_size 2048M;
    proxy_connect_timeout 600;
    proxy_send_timeout 600;
    proxy_read_timeout 600;
    send_timeout 600;

## Development

### Contributing

If you spot a bug or want to contribute feel free to create an issue.

### Requirements

-   Node.js >= 14

### Setup

-   Clone the repository
-   `npm ci`
-   Copy `.env.example` into a new `.env`
-   Configure the `.env` file:
    -   `NODE_ENV=development` (default)
    -   Choose a **different** port for the server & the websockets server. `3000` and `4000` are default.
    -   Choose some SESSION_SECRET
-   You have to start two processes for development.
    -   `npm run dev:server`
    -   `npm run dev:client`
-   The app is accessible at `https://localhost:3000`

### Architecture

SyncParty is written in TypeScript, using ES Modules.

The server is built with Express, Sequelize, sqlite, express-session. Cookie-based authentication: Passport.js.

The client is a React application in TypeScript.

Realtime communication is realized with Socket.io. Video chat via PeerJS.

The built client application is delivered via the app server. If you run `npm run prod:deploy`, the built files are copied into the `public` dir of the build folder. An `index.html` is statically served to respond to all requests, except those routed to `/api/...`. A reverse proxy like nginx is needed to use HTTPS. You can find an example configuration above.

## Admin CLI

### Creating Users

The app has to be built before you can create users.

-   Development: Just run `npm run dev:server`
-   Production: `npm run prod:server:build` or having run `npm run prod:deploy` at least once

You can run the following commands with a **preceding space**, preventing the passwords from being written into your bash history. [TODO better CLI]

-   Create an admin user:
    -   This user can create parties, add guests to parties etc. Usually there is only one admin and this is you.
    -   Choose an excellent & unique password!
    -   `[SPACE] npm run cli create-user <USERNAME> <PASSWORD> admin`
-   Create other users:
    -   Choose a good & unique password! Users can upload arbitrary files to your server.
    -   `[SPACE] npm run cli create-user <USERNAME> <PASSWORD>`

### All Commands

`[SPACE TO BYPASS BASH HISTORY] npm run cli ` +

-   `create-user <USERNAME> <PASSWORD> [admin]`
-   `list-users`
-   `delete-user <USERNAME>`
-   `delete-all-users`
-   `change-password <USERNAME> <NEW PASSWORD>`
-   `add-file <FILE_NAME> <TITLE> <OWNER_USERNAME>`
